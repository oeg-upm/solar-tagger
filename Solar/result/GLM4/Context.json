The quantification of the photoproduct was used to estimate quantum yields for photocatalytic reactions of CO2 under the specific experimental conditions. For the reduction to formic acid only, the estimated quantum yield was \u223c0.3%, which was likely lower than the overall quantum yield for the CO2 conversion (because of conversion to other photoproducts such as methanol; see Figure 1). Nevertheless, even for the production of formic acid alone, the observed quantum yield is already at the higher end of the available literature values for reactions with a variety of photocatalysts under many different conditions. As a more direct comparison, the use of suspended TiO2 nanoparticles (Degussa P25) as photocatalysts with UV light irradiation (through a 350 nm cutoff filter) in the same photolysis setup resulted in quantum yields that were an order of magnitude lower (also for formic acid only).

For the platinum-coated photocatalysts in the CO2 conversion reaction under otherwise identical experimental conditions, the results were generally similar to those with the gold-coated ones described above, though more quantitative comparisons, including those for effects of varying amounts of metal coating, are still being pursued. Mechanistically, photoexcitation of the surface-passivated small carbon nanoparticles likely results in charge separation to form surface-confined electrons and holes (Figure 1), on which significant experimental evidence has already become available. For example, the bright fluorescence emissions, which can be attributed to radiative recombinations on the particle surface, could be quenched by both electron donors and acceptors in an equally efficient fashion. The emissions were also essentially diminished by the gold or platinum coating, as the coated metal was designed to soak up the surface-confined electrons, disrupting the", "into the visible region, have been developed.

[14].The artificial light (320-500 nm) was supplied by Exfo Acticure 4000 with a highest intensity at 365 nm using an appropriate color filter.The light intensity was measured with a Lumen meter (Exfo).In order to determine the photoactivity of catalyst under real sun, concentrated natural sunlight was collected by using a solar concentrator (Himawari, Japan) as shown in Fig. 1.The reflection dish of the solar concentrator is able to track the sun trajectory during a day.So we can obtain the maximum sunlight intensity.The concentrated sunlight is transmitted via an optical cable and focused on the window of the photo reactor.The light intensity is then measured at the window of the reactor with unit of mW/cm 2 .The reactor was covered with a heating tape connected to temperature controller with a thermocouple placed at the top of the catalyst bed to main-tain the reaction at around 75 \u00b0C.The reactor was purged by CO 2 gas bubbling through distilled water for 1 h at 75 \u00b0C before and during the", "with those of N3-dye-Cu(0.5 wt%)-Fe(0.5wt%)/TiO 2 counterpart.However, under the concentrated natural sunlight with the average intensity of ca.60 mW/cm 2 , Cu(0.5 wt%)-Fe(0.5wt%)/TiO 2 catalyst coated on optical fiber only produces methane with very low production rate of 0.281 lmol/ g-cat h.Meanwhile, N3-dye-Cu(0.5 wt%)-Fe(0.5wt%)/TiO 2 catalyst coated on optical fiber still maintains almost the same order of magnitude for methane production under concentrated natural sunlight as compared to that under artificial light irradiation (Tables 1 and3) despite the average intensity of concentrated natural sunlight of only ca.20 mW/cm 2 .These results once again could be ascribed to the strong visible light absorption of the N3-dye-Cu(0.5 wt%)-Fe(0.5wt%)/TiO 2 catalyst as compared to that of Cu(0.5 wt%)-Fe(0.5wt%)/TiO 2 counterpart.Note that the wavelength of our artificial light is 320-500 nm while the wavelength of the concentrated sunlight is extended to the range of 500-800 nm.The N3-dye-Cu(0.5", "is found to be stable under UV irradiation as well as CO 2 photoreduction.This result could be ascribed to the efficient charge transfer in N3-dye-TiO 2 system.Otherwise, N3 dye would be observed to be decomposed after the photoreaction. The rate and quantum yield of methane and ethylene production over TiO 2 -based catalysts under artificial light are shown in  Tables 1 and2, respectively.It is found that production rate of methane and ethylene are similar over both Cu(0.5 wt%)-Fe(0.5wt%)/TiO 2 and N3-dye-Cu(0.5 wt%)-Fe(0.5wt%)/TiO 2 catalysts coated on optical fibers.Accordingly, quantum yields of methane and ethylene production over these catalysts are also observed comparable as shown in Table 2.The results in Table 1 imply that N3 dye is not effective for improvement of methane and ethylene production over the catalysts coated on glass fiber.Meanwhile, N3 dye is found to bring about the improvement of methane evolution on the catalyst coated on glass plate as shown in Table 1.This phenomenon could be", "about the improvement of methane evolution on the catalyst coated on glass plate as shown in Table 1.This phenomenon could be explained by the direct contact between light and dye in catalyst coated on glass plate.Whereas, in the case of catalyst coated on optical fiber the light is scattered in TiO 2 matrix when it is reaching to the adsorbed dye.Although the glass plate is a promising carrier for dye adsorbed catalyst to increase methane production, its total fuel production rate is too low as compared to that of dye adsorbed catalyst coated on optical fiber as depicted in Table 1. Accordingly, for the experiments using concentrated natural sunlight as the irradiation source, optical fiber is employed as a catalyst carrier.The data are shown in Table 3.Interestingly, N3 dye is observed to increase the photoactivity of Cu(0.5 wt%)-Fe(0.5wt%)/TiO 2 catalyst up to over 100% under concentrated nat-ural sunlight.The superior photo production of dye adsorbed catalyst could be ascribed to the strong absorption of"]}}]}
